==============================================================
1. Download the application files.

2. Open a console or terminal and run the following command to install the dependencies :

      ```bash
      npm install express path session
  _Make sure you are in the correct directory where the requirements.txt file is located_
  
  Once the dependencies are installed, run __`node index.js`__ to launch the application.
  
  ⚠️ Carefull, before executing the file replace `votre-ip` line 18 of index.js with __``your ip``__ on a classic site, unless you have executed the script on localhost replace with __``::1``__ ⚠️
